Welcome! 

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

This template provides a skeleton file structure that you can edit to create your book. It is built on six chapters, which correspond to five R Markdown documents: `01-abstract.Rmd`, `02-intro.Rmd`, `03-methods.Rmd`, `04-results.Rmd`, `05-discussion.Rmd`, `06-references`. Note: 1) there's also an `index.Rmd` file that is also a required script for a `bookdown` document. 2) the References document is auto-populated using information from `.bib` files in your folder when the book is created. So you generally can leave `06-references.Rmd` unedited.

You can change some of the configuration options for this html book document by editing `_bookdown.yml`. [This webpage](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/configuration.html#configuration) provides information on what fields to add and edit.
